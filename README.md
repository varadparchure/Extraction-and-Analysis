## Data Extraction and Analysis


Files:

1. Extract data and analysis.ipynb (Jupyter File)
2. Generated Text (Folder with extracted data)
3. Stop Words folder
4. Negative words txt file
5. Positive words txt file
6. Input File

OUTPUT FILES:

Note:

1. If you are running the jupyter file check the file location. The txt generated files are first saved on desktp and then I have added them into the
   Generated Text folder.
2. All file paths are my system specific, you might be needed to change them in order to run the code successfully.
